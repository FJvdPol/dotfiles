# Folkert's Dotfiles
My bash settings.

## Installation
Download the files and place them in your root directory (~/.filename)  
Or take the parts of the code you need and put them in your own .bash_profile or .bashrc.

If you decide to use my aliases **and** my profile, put both files in the same folder (`~/.bash_profile` & `~/.bash_aliases`)

(you can get in the ~ directory by typing `cd ~` in your terminal)

## What does it do?
Basically, it changes your prompt.
